# Distributed Assertion Management Framework

![DAMF Logo](/assets/logo/damf.png){ width="60" }
The _Distributed Assertion Management Framework_ (DAMF) is a proposed collection
of formats and techniques to enable heterogeneous formal reasoning systems and
users to communicate _assertions_ in a decentralized, reliable, and egalitarian
manner. An _assertion_ is a unit of mathematical knowledge---think lemmas,
theorems, corollaries, etc.---that is cryptographically signed by its
originator.

The philosophy and beginnings of DAMF are explained in this technical report:

The technical construction of DAMF is explained in this paper:

> Reasoning using Distributed Assertions][frocos23damf]_ ([HAL][hal-frocos]).
> Appeared in the proceedings of the [14th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining
> Systems (FroCoS)][frocos23], September 20--23, 2023.

DAMF is based on content-addressable storage using the _[InterPlanetary File
System][ipfs]_ (IPFS) network, and uses the _[InterPlanetary Linked Data][ipld]_
(IPLD) data model to represent assertions and all their components.
