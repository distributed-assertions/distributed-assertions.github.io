&lambda;Prolog is logic programming language that extends Prolog in a number of ways. In particular, it has a built-in and declarative treatment of term-level bindings.  For more about &lambda;Prolog, see:

 - The [&lambda;Prolog home page](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lProlog/)
 - The book [Programming with Higher-Order Logic](https://sites.google.com/site/proghol/) by D. Miller and G. Nadathur describes the logic, design, and applications for &lambda;Prolog.

There are two main implementations of &lambda;Prolog.

 - [ELPI](https://github.com/LPCIC/elpi/): an embeddable λProlog interpreter. [Version 1.16.7](https://github.com/LPCIC/elpi/) was released on 20 October 2022.
 - [Teyjus](https://github.com/teyjus/teyjus) compiler of λProlog. [Version 2.1.1](https://github.com/teyjus/teyjus/releases) was released on 7 February 2023.


Code exists for outputing JSON objects suitable for input to the DAMF Dispatch program.  Since &lambda;Prolog is not central to the main examples provided in our draft paper, this code is not yet generally available.

TODO: Provide a description of the &lambda;Prolog code for generating JSON objects for input to the DAMF Dispatch program.
